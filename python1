#The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

import csv
list = []
for x in range(2000,3201):

    if x%7==0 and x%5!=0:

        list.append(x)

        with open('numbers.csv', 'w') as file:

            writer = csv.writer(file)

            writer.writerow(list)
